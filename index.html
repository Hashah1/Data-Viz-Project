            <br/><br/>According to this <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/280704/world-power-consumption/">statistic</a>, in 2017, the world consumption of 
            electricity was a whopping 22.3 Trillion KWH. This gives an idea of how much of a need there is for electricity, and the necessity of it for other undeveloped areas of the world.
            
            <br/><br/>Perhaps, the most amazing and life-changing innovation made by humans is electricity. 
            <br/>Survival without electricity is unimaginable now but there was a time when people lived without light and electronic appliances
            <br/><br/>In today's age, access to electricity is crucial. Although there's been a lot of development in the world, 
            there are still areas that do not have as much access to electricity as others. 
            More so, there's an issue in rural areas as well. 
            <br/><br/>That being said, the explorer page gives the user an idea
            of the statistics of how much % of the population in majority geographical regions in the world have access to electricity.
            It gives an idea of this over a period of 18 years (1990 - 2018).
            <br/><br/>Upon going to the next page, the data will be shown for urban regions for the year 2018. The data can be changed accordingly based off the top
            right triggers. Feel free to explore the various percentage statistics for the regions shown! 
            <br/><br/>
            Enjoy!
