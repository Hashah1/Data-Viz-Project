This narrative visualisation gives an idea of the percentage of access to electricity in more developed geographical regions. The structure followed is the Martini Glass Narrative design. Initially, the website provides the user with an introduction and the importance of electricity. The next page renders a bar chart displaying percentage access to electricity for some regions. These regions are Europe & Central Asia, European Union, Middle East & North Africa, North America, South Asia, United States, and the explorer page provides this information for Urban as well as Rural parts of these regions from 1990 to 2018. With enough exploration, the user will notice a great disparity between rural and urban regions as well as in comparison with its peers
