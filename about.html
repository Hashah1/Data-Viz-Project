            In today's age, access to electricity is crucial. Although there's been a lot of development in the world, 
            there are still areas in the world that do not have as much access to electricity as others. 
            More so, there's an issue in rural areas as well. 
            <br/><br/>That being said, the explorer page gives the user an idea
            of the statistics of how much % of the population in majority geographical regions in the world have access to electricity.
            The explorer page gives an idea of how the access percentages have changed over the period of 18 years (1990 - 2018). 
            <br/><br/>This gives an idea of how development has taken place and which areas need more development - because to move forward with technology,
            we need to have access to that technology.

            <br/><br/>According to this <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/280704/world-power-consumption/">statistic</a>, in 2017, the world consumption of 
            electricity was a whopping 22.3 Trillion KWH. This gives an idea of how mcuh of a need there is for electricity, and the necessity of it for other undeveloped areas of the world.
